My income has dropped substantially in the past 5 years and I am now on a low fixed income. On XXXX separate occasions from XXXX to XXXX I had zero income and had to use my Sams Club card to purchase food, thus running up debt out of necessity. I am currently in the process of attempting to pay down my Sams Club ( Synchrony Bank ) card, and stopped using the card some time ago. I have always made at least minimum payments and have never missed a payment. Despite this, my interest rate has been unilaterally raised three times in the past two years, and is now at 23.15 %. I called a Sams Club account rep today to file a complaint over the phone, because I am never going to be able to pay down this card when I am paying almost {$50.00} a month in interest and can only afford to pay the minimum payment + {$4.00} or {$5.00} dollars. They would not work with me, which I expected. In my opinion, Synchrony Bank is taking unfair advantage of recent interest rate hikes to gouge customers, especially those who are financially unable to make substantial monthly payments on their accounts.
